IMDB Sentiment Analysis Project 
This project focuses on sentiment analysis using the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset. The goal is to build a deep learning model that classifies movie reviews as either positive or negative based on their text content. The project demonstrates the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Keras for building and training a sentiment analysis model.
